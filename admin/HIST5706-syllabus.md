## Sept 13- Module 1: Getting to Know the Field

- Week 1: Article Annotation Prep (select 4)

Following the directions on the course website, you will pre-read your readings, annotating the important elements as you go, for us all to discuss asynchronously the following week.

> ***NB*** that none of these readings constitutes a ‘canon’; rather, they are as much a starting place, a jumping off point, for a deeper engagement with the materials. Feel free to drop any of these into Google Scholar to see how, and in what contexts, these works are being cited… and if you do, and you find something better , why, let’s read that, too…
