Which readings do you _really_ want to explore?


Hello all! I've dabble at least a little bit in each of the areas of focus and frankly have never *not* enjoyed my experiences, so I spent a good while clicking through all of the syllabus options trying to make a decision on which focus I wanted to "settle" on! In the end I went with the classic focus of "data" (the girl with a data science specialization choosing data? absolutely groundbreaking, I know). In my own research, I've actually been focusing more on the applications of various machine learning tech for historical inquiry, but regardless of the wild output I end up with, the project always starts with some sort of basic data, so to me, data is almost the foundation of DH. With that being said, I'm really eager to read Sharon Leon's article "The Peril and Promise of Historians as Data Creators"-- the discourse surrounding ethical data creation as humanists, preservation of data, and the use of open data in our increasingly digital world are incredibly important aspects to consider when doing DH work but that can often be overlooked when the final output of a project is what's prioritized (Ã  la Google ousting their lead ethics researcher at least partially due to her criticism of their prized large language models: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/).  

I'm not quite sure what shape my final project will take yet, but I do have a very tiny but firm goal of completing the "Publishing data with Datasette" tutorial and implementing what I learn. I am **constantly** using large amounts of data in its "raw" format when publishing things on the web and it's seriously slowing down everything I do! I'm determined to finally force myself to *properly* store and distribute data beyond just through Github ðŸ’ª
