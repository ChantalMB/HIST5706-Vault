[Enriching Historic Photography with Structured Data using Image Region Segmentation](https://statsmaths.github.io/pdf/2020-enrich-photography.pdf)
- Summary points
  - Using CV to detect various components of image to automatically generate [structured data triples] the describe the content of an image (in this case, historic photography)
  - Creation of metadata using ML methodolgy
    - While records may include extensive metadata about the provenance of a digital image, there is often little to no structured data pertaining to the content of the image itself. Even when descriptive captions exist, these are typically short and intended to be read alongside the object itself.

[On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)
- In §4, we discuss how large datasets based on texts from the Internet overrepresent hegemonic viewpoints and encode biases potentially damaging to marginalized populations. In collecting ever larger datasets we risk incurring documentation debt.
- As we outline in §3, increasing the environmental and financial costs of these models doubly punishes marginalized communities that are least likely to benefit from the progress achieved by large LMs and most likely to be harmed by negative environmental consequences of its resource consumption
- As argued by Bender and Koller [14], it is important to understand the limitations of LMs and put their success in context.
- Important bc we often perform and enhance tech for the sake of progress before stopping and asking ourselves "why" or about the implications of the work
-  the tendency of training data ingested from the Internet to encode hegemonic worldviews, the tendency of LMs to amplify biases and other issues in the training data, and the tendency of researchers and other people to mistake LM-driven performance gains for actual natural language understanding
-  We note that the risks associated with synthetic but seemingly coherent text are deeply connected to the fact that such synthetic text can enter into conversations without any person or entity being accountable for it
- This, in turn, means making time in the research process for considering environmental impacts, for doing careful data curation and documentation, for engaging with stakeholders early in the design process, for exploring multiple possible paths towards long-term goals, for keeping alert to dual-use scenarios, and finally for allocating research effort to harm mitigation in such cases.

[We Are All Digital Now: Digital Photography and the Reshaping of Historical Practice](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/article/777493)
- Summary points
  - Thesis:  In this article, I argue that, through specific reference to the use of digital archival photography, we can see the varied ways in which historical work is being adapted to these new and emerging technological circumstances. Whereas, previously, there was considerably more interplay in historical research between the functions of document selection, reading, reflecting, and writing, we now increasingly see historical labour divided into two stages: the collecting/processing stage and the reading/writing stage.

In this article, Dr. Ian Milligan looks at the changing practices of Canadian historians' work within the archive, primarily regarding the ways they spend time at the archive capturing information for their research. His survey specifically looked at the "digital method" many wouldn't consider to be a digital method at all-- the use of digital archival photography.

By comparing previous archival practices to the present, Milligan establishes a fundamental shift in how archival research is performed. Rather than the archive being the heart of historical labour-- a place where research was all at once curated, reflected upon, and written about-- as it once was, with the emergence of technologies such as digital cameras and smartphones, historical labour has become split between stages of collection at the archive and reflection at the office or home as engagement with the archive becomes mediated by a (literal) digital lens and documents previously only accessible physically at one facility become portable through a photographic capture. This rapidly evolving new methodolgy ultimately raises questions about the nature of historical work in our present; about what kind of training historians should receive, how digital archival photography changes the way which historical work is practiced, and how these technologies can ultimately be leveraged to benefit a larger number of researchers through support of formal digitization efforts.

[A Machine That Writes Like Mary Dorothy George](https://cradledincaricature.com/2020/06/18/mary-dorothy-george/)

This piece by Dr. James Baker details his experimentation with the machine learning tool GPT-2-- a text generating langauage model-- when it is applied to a corpus of  catalogue entries written by 20th century historian Mary Dorothy George. Baker's research on George involves analyzing how her [curatorial voice](https://curatorialvoice.github.io/) influences our understanding of the late-Georgian satirical prints she catalogued, thus this article walks us through both the creation process and performance of a simulated version of George's image descriptions with the goal of possibly discovering more about the themes and trends found in her work as they emerge within her automated writings.

As Baker delves into the technical elements of generative text alongside the historiographical debates surrounding knowledge production when analyzing the outputs of "simGeorge", he highlights the ethical qualms and faults that result from using large-scale language models both generally and for historical inquiry.
